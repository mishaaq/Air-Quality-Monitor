  OLED_I2C.h - Arduino/chipKit library support for 128x64 pixel SSD1306 OLEDs
  Copyright (C)2015 Rinky-Dink Electronics, Henning Karlsen. All right reserved
  
  This library has been made to make it easy to use 128x64 pixel OLED displays
  based on the SSD1306 controller chip with an Arduino or a chipKit.

  You can always find the latest version of the library at 
  http://www.RinkyDinkElectronics.com/

  will allow commercial use. This includes using the library,
  modified or not, as a tool to sell products.

  examples and tools supplied with the library.

  Adoptated for Z-Uno project by Z-Wave>ME 2016
  Reworked to reduce stack and memory usage by  Z-Wave>ME 2017
    
  Added support for SH1106 128x64 display by michap (9/2018).
  Works with buffer only - take 1024byte RAM !!!
